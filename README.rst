Packages that should—but cannot—be part of the `Brain Imaging Analysis Kit`_.


Requirements
============

The requirements for `brainiak-extras` are generally the same as for the `Brain Imaging Analysis Kit`_
itself, and you should follow those instructions first. After those instructions have been completed,
you can install using `pip3`::

    pip3 install --process-dependency-links -U -e .
